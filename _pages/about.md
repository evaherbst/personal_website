    ** Note this site is under construnction**
This year I switched from being an evolutionary biomechanist and palaeontologist to working on clinical shoulder biomechanics. I am still fascinated by how form relates to function, and am excited to work in a new field. I really enjoy developing new methods and my goal with this website is to share some of the things I have learned. I am also a founder of [Finite Element Zurich](https://fez-finite-element-zurich.github.io/), an initiative to make finite element modeling more accessible by sharing resources. "
