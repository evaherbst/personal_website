    excerpt: "**Postdoctoral Researcher in Shoulder Biomechanics**<br />
    <br />
    *ETH and Schulthess Clinic*<br />
    <br />
I develop computational shoulder models combining finite element analysis and multibody dynamics to investigate dynamic joint loading in patients. I am based at the Laboratory for Orthopaedic Technology with [Prof. Dr. Stephen Ferguson](https://orthotech.ethz.ch/the-group/people/person-detail.MTc5Njgw.TGlzdC8xMzcwLDE3NTMxODM4ODU=.html). I work in close collaboration with [Prof. Dr. med. Philipp Moroder](https://www.schulthess-klinik.ch/en/specialist/prof-dr-med-univ-philipp-moroder) at the Schulthess Clinic to maximize the clinical impact of my simulation work. I am a comparative biomechanist and palaeontologist by training but am now directing my efforts towards clinical applications. I remain fascinated by the link between form and function. I really enjoy developing new methods and my goal with this website is to share tools I have developed. I am also a founder of (Finite Element Zurich)[https://fez-finite-element-zurich.github.io/], an initiative to make finite element modeling more accessible by sharing resources."
